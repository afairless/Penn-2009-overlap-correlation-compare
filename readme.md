NonOverlappingCorrelCompare
Andrew Fairless, July 2009

This program calculates whether two correlations are significantly different when they are correlated with each other.
The calculations in this program follow Steiger (1980), Tests for Comparing Elements of a Correlation Matrix, Psychological Bulletin, Vol 87 No 2, 245-251.

This program takes a correlation matrix, the number of cases covered by the correlations (N), and the two cells containing the correlations to be compared as input.

This program was modified from an earlier program that was written for a matrix of non-overlapping correlations.
This program is appropriate for overlapping correlations
